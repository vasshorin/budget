# A budget tracker app that allows users to track their expenses and income.
# This app uses a MongoDB database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express. Using the app, users can add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
